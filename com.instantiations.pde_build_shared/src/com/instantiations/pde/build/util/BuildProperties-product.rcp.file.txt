	The "product.rcp.file" property is undefined.
	This property defines the name of the RCP product file without the .product extension.
	(e.g. if the RCP product file is Foo.product and it is loacated in plugin com.foo.plugin 
	then the value of this property will be 
		plugins/com.foo.plugin/Foo)
	This property should NOT contain the .product extension.
	For example if the product file is Foo.product and it is loacated in plugin com.foo.plugin then 
		product.rcp.file = plugins/com.foo.plugin/Foo
	
	Second Example if the product file (Foo.product) and it is in sub directory products in the 
	feature com.foo.feature_feature then the value would be
	
		product.rcp.file = features/com.foo.feature_feature/products/Foo
		
	It is recommended that you define this property in:
	
		${product.build.project}/build-settings/product.properties

	A list of property files that were read should appear earlier in the log.
