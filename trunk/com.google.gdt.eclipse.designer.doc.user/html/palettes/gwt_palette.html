				<li><b>HTMLPanel</b> - A panel that contains HTML, and which can 
				attach child widgets to identified elements within that HTML.</li>

				widget will only work in standards mode.</i></li>
				<li><b>StackLayoutPanel</b> - A panel that stacks its children 
				vertically, displaying only one at a time, with a header for 
				each child which the user can click to display. <i>Note: this 
				widget will only work in standards mode.</i></li>
				<li><b>StackPanel</b> - A panel that stacks its children 
				vertically, displaying only one at a time, with a header for 
				each child which the user can click to display.</li>

				out in a single vertical column.</li>

            <ul>
              <li><b>AbsoluteLayout</b> - Inherits the anchoring of AnchorLayout 
				and adds the ability for x/y positioning using the standard x 
				and y component config options.</li>
              <li><b>AccordionLayout</b> - This is a layout that contains 
				multiple panels in an expandable accordion style such that only 
				one panel can be open at any given time. Each panel has built-in 
				support for expanding and collapsing. Note that child Panels 
				added to a Panel with an AccordionLayout must have a title.</li>
              <li><b>AnchorLayout</b> - This is a layout that enables anchoring 
				of contained elements relative to the container's dimensions. If 
				the container is resized, all anchored items are automatically 
				rerendered according to their anchor rules.</li>
              <li><b>BorderLayout</b> - This is a multi-pane, 
				application-oriented UI layout style that supports multiple 
				nested panels, automatic split bars between regions and built-in 
				expanding and collapsing of regions.</li>
              <li><b>CardLayout</b> - This layout contains multiple panels, each 
				fit to the container, where only a single panel can be visible 
				at any given time. This layout style is most commonly used for 
				wizards, tab implementations, etc.</li>
              <li><b>ColumnLayout</b> - This is the layout style of choice for 
				creating structural layouts in a multi-column format where the 
				width of each column can be specified as a percentage or fixed 
				width, but the height is allowed to vary based on the content. 
				The basic rules for specifying column widths are pretty simple. 
				The logic makes two passes through the set of contained panels. 
				During the first layout pass, all panels that either have a 
				fixed width or none specified (auto) are skipped, but their 
				widths are subtracted from the overall container width. During 
				the second pass, all panels with columnWidths are assigned pixel 
				widths in proportion to their percentages based on the total 
				&lt;b&gt;remaining&lt;/b&gt; container width. In other words, percentage 
				width panels are designed to fill the space left over by all the 
				fixed-width or auto-width panels. Because of this, while you can 
				specify any number of columns with different percentages, the 
				columnWidths must always add up to 1 (or 100%) when added 
				together, otherwise your layout may not render as expected.</li>
              <li><b>FitLayout</b> - This is a base class for layouts that 
				contain a single item that automatically expands to fill the 
				layout's container.</li>
              <li><b>FormLayout</b> - This is a layout specifically designed for 
				creating forms. Usually you don't need to create instances of 
				this layout directly. It will usually be preferrable to use a 
				FormPanel (which automatically uses FormLayout as its layout 
				class) since it also provides built-in functionality for 
				loading, validating and submitting the form.</li>
              <li><b>HorizontalLayout</b> - Horizontal layout which allows you 
				to lay out components horizontally in a row with the specified 
				spacing between components.</li>
              <li><b>RowLayout</b> - Layout that distributes heights of elements 
				so they take 100% of the container height.Height of the child 
				element can be given in pixels (as an integer) or in percent. 
				All elements with absolute height (i.e. in pixels) always will 
				have the given height. All &quot;free&quot; space (that is not filled with 
				elements with 'absolute' height) will be distributed among other 
				elements in proportion of their height percentage.</li>
              <li><b>TableLayout</b> - This layout allows you to easily render 
				content into an HTML table. The total number of columns can be 
				specified, and rowspan and colspan can be used to create complex 
				layouts within the table.</li>
              <li><b>VerticalLayout</b> - Vertical layout that allows you to add 
				components vertically with the specified spacing between them.</li>

              <li><b>FormPanel</b> - FormPanel uses a FormLayout internally, and
