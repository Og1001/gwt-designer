	<exception id="4000" title="Can't find GWT module">GWT Designer can't find GWT module
		<code>{0}</code> in project. Possible reasons: <ol>
			<li>There really are no module with this ID. For example, it was just mistyped or
				accidentally broken.</li>

	<exception id="4001" title="Panel should not be used as superclass.">GWT Designer is designed to
		edit any standard GWT GUI type like EntryPoints, Composites, PopupPanels and DialogBoxes. It
		is not designed to directly edit widget classes (this is intentional). GWT best practices
		dictate that custom composites of existing panels and widgets should be created as
		subclasses of Composite. GWT panel types should *not* be subclassed unless you are actually
		creating a true custom panel type. Change your class to a Composite that contains a
			<code>{0}</code> and GWT Designer should be able to edit it.</exception>
	<exception id="4002" title="GWT Mail sample problem." warning="true">This Mail example has a bug
		and is poorly designed from an OO point of view to begin with. It throws an NPE at design
		time (it's not very carefully written), so you need to fix the following
		NullPointerException: <pre>{0}</pre>
		<p>The MailList class sends a get() call to the Mail class to access its singleton without
			testing that it is non null or ensuring that the singleton is actually created. The
			get() method itself returns the singleton field without ensuring that it is populated.
			The example relies on runtime-specific behavior to populate the singleton instance (the
			call to the Mail.onLoadModule() method). When editing the Mail class at design time,
			there is no instance of the Mail class created. The Mail class is parsed; it is not
			instantiated. Any code that tries to actually access the instance of the class being
			edited will not work because there is no such instance.</p>
		<p>If you comment out the line Mail.get().displayItem(item); in the MailList class (or add
			an null check for Mail.get() prior to that line), the Mail class should open just fine.</p>
		<p>From a purely OO point of view, the Mail example is poorly designed. The classes are
			tightly coupled (when they don't need to be) and the MailList class unnecessarily breaks
			encapsulation by talking directly back to the Mail class via its singleton.</p>
